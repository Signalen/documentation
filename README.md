# README

This is the Signalen documentation repository. The documentation is built using GitBook and synced towards this repository automatically. The main branch is only used for documentation about how the documentation system works and how you can contribute.

There are two branches:

* nl-0.1 - Contains the Dutch version 0.1 of the documentation
* en-0.1 -Contains the English version of the documenation
* main - This README and other meta documentation about the documentation system itself

To add or contribute to the documentation create a seperate branch on 'nl' or 'en' branch and merge it back into the nl-0.x or en-0.x.
This branching strategy does not follow normal conventions and will be changed on a later date

The documentation is hosted by Gitbook on https://docs.signalen.org
